 UnityLearn Unit 1 + Bonus Features

 A month or so ago, my 9yo and I decided to add [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/)'s [Junior Programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) to our homeschool curriculum.
 
 The Junior Programmer pathway involves making small video game-type projects with Unity + C#. Incorporating it into our homeschool curriculum was my attempt to use my son's passion for video games as a stepping stone towards getting him into programming.

 So far, we've had some pretty good luck on it: We're figuring stuff out as we go, and he's having a blast! I'm super stoked about how it's going, and as such, documenting the progress here seems like a worthwhile endeavor.
